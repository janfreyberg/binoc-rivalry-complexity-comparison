# binoc-rivalry-complexity-comparison
Exp. to measure rivalry with simple and complex stimuli

The script runs a total of 36 trials:
6 each of rivalry with gratings and pictures
6 each of rivalry simulation with gratings and pictures
6 each of rivalry sudden-onset simulation with gratings and pictures

Each trial is 40s long, and the script samples keypress every 4 ms.

To calibrate stimulus distance, move the two boxes (black and white) with the Up and Down arrows until the participant reports them as abutting. Then press Enter, and check if the participant now only sees one (merged) box on the screen.
